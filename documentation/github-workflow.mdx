# GitHub Submission Workflow

DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources are

- written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language with easy-to-learn,
  plain-text formatting syntax; and
- hosted on GitHub, a popular repository hosting service based on the
  open-source version control sotware called git.

To submit content to DARIAH-CAMPUS, you should:

- use a text editor that supports Markdown. If you don't already use one, we
  recommend Atom.
- be familiar with our GitHub submission and editing workflow.

## Setting up Atom

If you don't already use a Markdown-enabled text editor but wish to create
content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you may want to use Atom, a customizable,
cross-platform open-source text editor.

If you already use a Mardkown-enabled editor, you should continue to do so.
We're providing the instructions how to set up Atom only for those who are new
to Markdown. You should stick to the tools you know (and hopefully like).

1. Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io).
2. Open Atom.
3. Go to Atom > Preferences (if you are on a Mac) or File > Settings (if you are
   on Windows). Then click on Install: ![](images/atom_settings.png)
4. Make sure the "Packages" tab next to the search field is selected. Then type
   "mdxjs" in the search field and wait for results to show up. You should see a
   package called language-mdxjs in the results. Click on install.

5. In the search field, type: "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Install
   markdown-preview-enhanced.
6. Once the install finishes, click on Settings:
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings.png)
7. Once you open the settings for Markdown Preview Enhanced, you should see
   something like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings2.png)
8. Click on the File Extension input field in Settings and type `, .mdx` after
   `.markdown` like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings3.png)
9. Finally, go back to "Install", search for and install "Toolbar Markdown
   Writer".
10. Atom will ask you if you want to install dependencies, click on "Yes":

You should now have a functioning environment in Atom for your work on new
DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources.

## Setting up DARIAH-CAMPUS on your computer

1. If you haven't used GitHub before, make sure you
   [sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free account before you proceed.
2. Make sure you're logged in on GitHub.com.
3. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your
   computer.
4. Open GitHub Desktop on your computer.
5. Authenticate your GitHub Desktop application with your GitHub credentials by
   following these
   [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github).
6. In your browser, go to
   [https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus)
   and click on "fork". ![](images/github_fork.png)
7. If you are a contributor to various organizational repositories, GitHub may
   ask you to select where you would like to fork dariah-campus. Make your
   choice. ![](images/github_fork_to_which_repo.png)
8. Once the forking finishes, you will be taken to your own personal fork of
   DARIAH-CAMPUS. To make sure you are in the fork, check out that your user
   name (or the name of the organizational repository youo selected in step 7
   above) is displayed in the upper left corner.
   ![](images/github_fork_check_your_name.png)
9. Click on "Clone or download", then select "Open in Desktop".
   ![](images/github_clone_and_open_in_desktop.png)
10. In GitHub Desktop, choose where you want to save the cloned DARIAH-CAMPUS
    fork on your computer. ![](images/github_desktop_saving_a_fork.png)
11. The first you do this, it may take a couple of minutes, but don't despair,
    things will be quicker after the initial clone. Once you finish cloning your
    fork, you should see something like this:
    ![](images/github_desktop_result_of_cloned_fork.png)
12. To get to the folder with DARIAH-CAMPUS on your computer, click on Open in
    Atom (or your preferred editor, if you already set it up).

## Contributing to DARIAH-CAMPUS

NOTE: this is still in shorthand -- I will describe these in more detail (TT).

- explain fetch origin vs. merge from upstream and list

### Work on your fork

1. **Fetch origin**
2. **Merge from upstream** ![](images/github_merge_from_upstream.png)

3. Do your work
4. Save changes in atom
5. Go to GitHub Desktop
6. Make sure your recent changes are reflected in the Changes Tab:
   ![](images/github_changes.png)
7. Write a short commit message for the changes you want to submit. You can
   leave the Description field emtpy: ![](images/github_commit_message.png)
8. **Commit your work.** Click on "commit to master". This will save your
   initial work to _your_ fork _locally_.
9. **Push to your fork.** Click on Push origin. This will save your work to
   _your_ fork _remotely_. ![](images/github_push_origin.png) After you push,
   you can go to your fork on GitHub and click on "Commits". You will see that
   your changes have been committed to your fork on github.com.

### Submit to DARIAH-CAMPUS editors

1. make sure you have no uncommitted changes
2. **Create a pull request.** Go to Branch > Create Pull Request.
   - A new window will open in your Browser
   - Click on the green button "Create pull request"
   - Click on create pull request This will alert the editors to look into your
     submission before making it public.

### Subsequent contributions

Before you make your next contribution, you have to make sure that your local
branch is up to date. Remember, you created your special little branch off of
the master at some point, but other people may have contributed to the master in
the meantime. So it's very important that you follow this procedure _every time_
you start doing work on your branch again.

1. **In GitHub Desktop, in your branch, fetch origin.** This will check whether
   there were any changes made to _your_ branch _remotely_.
2. **If GitHub Desktop instructs you to pull origin, pull origin.** This will
   make sure that _your local_ and _your remote branch_ are in sync. Which is
   important, if you have, for instance, used a different computer to commit and
   publish etc. Or if, God forbid, somebody messed around with your branch. They
   shouldn't. But it did happen at least once. And Toma was to blame :)
3. **Branch > Update from master** This will now, in addition, update _your
   local branch_ with all the contributions that have meanwhile been merged into
   the master from the other branches. Remember, each contributor works in their
   own branch.
4. **If GitHub Desktop instructs you to push origin, push origin.** This will
   make sure that the changes from the master branch, which you've added to
   _your local_ branch in the previous step, will also make it to _your remote
   branch_. With your local and remote branch fully updated and sync you can
   finally get to do your work.
5. **Do your work.**
6. **Commit your work.** This will save your work to _your_ branch _locally_.
7. **Push origin.** This will save your work to _your_ branch _remotely_.
8. **Create a pull request.** This will alert the repository admin person that
   there are changes that should be merged into the master branch, i.e. made
   public.

# GitHub Submission Workflow

DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources are

- written in **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language with easy-to-learn,
  plain-text formatting syntax; and
- hosted on **GitHub**, a popular repository hosting service based on the
  open-source version control sotware called git.

To submit content to DARIAH-CAMPUS, you should:

- use a text editor that supports Markdown. If you don't already use one, we
  recommend Atom.
- be familiar with our GitHub submission and editing workflow.

## Setting up Atom

If you don't already use a Markdown-enabled text editor but wish to create
content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you may want to use Atom, a customizable,
cross-platform open-source text editor.

If you already use a Mardkown-enabled editor, you should continue to do so.
We're providing the instructions how to set up Atom only for those who are new
to Markdown. You should stick to the tools you know (and hopefully like).

1. Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io).
2. Open Atom.
3. Go to Atom > Preferences (if you are on a Mac) or File > Settings (if you are
   on Windows). Then click on Install: ![](images/atom_settings.png)
4. Make sure the "Packages" tab next to the search field is selected. Then type
   "mdxjs" in the search field and wait for results to show up. You should see a
   package called language-mdxjs in the results. Click on install.

5. In the search field, type: "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Install
   markdown-preview-enhanced.
6. Once the install finishes, click on Settings:
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings.png)
7. Once you open the settings for Markdown Preview Enhanced, you should see
   something like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings2.png)
8. Click on the File Extension input field in Settings and type `, .mdx` after
   `.markdown` like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings3.png)
9. Uncheck the check box next to "Break On Single New Line":
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings4.png) You don't need to hit save.
10. Finally, go back to "Install", search for and install "Toolbar Markdown
    Writer".
11. Atom will ask you if you want to install dependencies, click on "Yes":
    ![](images/atom_markdown_toolbar_and_dependencies.png)

You should now have a functioning environment in Atom for your work on new
DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources.

## Setting up DARIAH-CAMPUS on your computer

1. If you haven't used GitHub before, make sure you
   [sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free account before you proceed.
2. Make sure you're logged in on GitHub.com.
3. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your
   computer.
4. Open GitHub Desktop on your computer.
5. Authenticate your GitHub Desktop application with your GitHub credentials by
   following these
   [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github).
6. In your browser, go to
   [https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus)
   and click on "fork". ![](images/github_fork.png)
7. If you are a contributor to various organizational repositories, GitHub may
   ask you to select where you would like to fork dariah-campus. Make your
   choice. ![](images/github_fork_to_which_repo.png)
8. Once the forking finishes, you will be taken to your own personal fork of
   DARIAH-CAMPUS. To make sure you are in the fork, check out that your user
   name (or the name of the organizational repository youo selected in step 7
   above) is displayed in the upper left corner.
   ![](images/github_fork_check_your_name.png)
9. Click on "Clone or download", then select "Open in Desktop".
   ![](images/github_clone_and_open_in_desktop.png)
10. In GitHub Desktop, choose where you want to save the cloned DARIAH-CAMPUS
    fork on your computer. ![](images/github_desktop_saving_a_fork.png)
11. The first you do this, it may take a couple of minutes, but don't despair,
    things will be quicker after the initial clone. Once you finish cloning your
    fork, you should see something like this:
    ![](images/github_desktop_result_of_cloned_fork.png)
12. To get to the folder with DARIAH-CAMPUS on your computer, click on Open in
    Atom (or your preferred editor, if you already set it up).

## Contributing to DARIAH-CAMPUS

When you work on your own learning resource, you will work locally, on your
computer, in the locally cloned fork of DARIAH-CAMPUS.

### Work on your contribution

Make sure you get into the habit of regularly syncing your local clone with the
remote clone and the original repository, as well as committing (saving) your
work both to your local clone and your remote server.

This may sound coumplicated, but is actually quite logical. Once you have done
it several times, it will become like second nature to you:

1. **Fetch origin**. Before you start a working session on your computer, make
   sure you "fetch origin": ![](images/github_desktop_fetch_origin.png) This
   will update your local fork with possible changes you've made to your
   "origin", i.e. your fork on GitHub.com. This is important if you're, for
   instance, working on more than one computer.
2. **Merge from upstream**. Also, before you start your working session, you
   should merge from upstream by going to Branch > Merge into current branch >
   Select upstream/master and then clicking on "Merge upstream/master into
   master" ![](images/github_merge_from_upstream.png) This will update your
   local fork with the changes that may have been submitted to the "upstream"
   DARIAH-CAMPUS, i.e. the original repository owned by DARIAH.
3. Do your work. On how to set up a new learning resource see USING TEMPLATES.
   TODO!
4. Save changes in Atom
5. Go to GitHub Desktop. You can see your recent changes are reflected in the
   Changes Tab: ![](images/github_changes.png)
6. Write a short commit message for the changes you want to submit. You can
   leave the Description field emtpy: ![](images/github_commit_message.png)
7. **Commit your work.** Click on "commit to master". This will save your
   initial work to _your_ fork _locally_.
8. **Push to your fork.** Click on "Push origin". This will save your work to
   _your_ fork _remotely_. ![](images/github_push_origin.png) After you push,
   you can go to your fork on GitHub and click on "Commits". You will see that
   your changes have been committed to your fork on GitHub.com.

You can repeat the above as many times as you want while working on your
learning resource. None of the changes you commit and push as described above
will be submitted to the DARIAH-CAMPUS editors.

### Submit to DARIAH-CAMPUS editors

Once you're ready to submit, follow these steps:

1. Open GitHub Desktop and make sure you have no uncommitted changes in the
   Changes tab.
2. **Create a pull request.** Go to Branch > Create Pull Request.
   ![](images/github_desktop_branch_pull_request.png)
   - A new window will open in your Browser. Click on the green button "Create
     pull request" ![](images/github_in_browser_create_pull_request.png)
   - If necessary, change the commit message. You don't have to leave a comment.
     Click on the green button "Create pull request".
     ![](images/github_in_browser_create_pull_request2.png) This will alert the
     editors that you have submitted a contribution for publication.

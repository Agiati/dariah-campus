DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources are

- written in **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language with easy-to-learn,
  plain-text formatting syntax; and
- hosted on **GitHub**, a popular repository hosting service based on the
  open-source version control software called git.

To develop content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you should:

- use a text editor that supports Markdown. If you don't already use one, we
  recommend Atom.
- be familiar with our GitHub submission and editing workflow.

In this chapter, we'll help you:

- set up Atom as your text editor
- get a copy of DARIAH-Campus on your computer so that you can work on your
  contribution locally
- show you how to run DARIAH-Campus on your computer so that you can preview
  your contribution to see exactly what it would look like once it's published
  on DARIAH-Campus.

## Setting up Atom

If you don't already use a Markdown-enabled text editor but wish to create
content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you may want to use Atom, a customizable,
cross-platform open-source text editor.

If you already use a Markdown-enabled editor, you should continue to do so.
We're providing the instructions how to set up Atom only for those who are new
to Markdown. You should stick to the tools you know (and hopefully like).

1. Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io).
2. Open Atom.
3. Go to Atom > Preferences (if you are on a Mac) or File > Settings (if you are
   on Windows). Then click on Install: ![](images/atom_settings.png)
4. Make sure the "Packages" tab next to the search field is selected. Then type
   "mdxjs" in the search field and wait for results to show up. You should see a
   package called language-mdxjs in the results. Click on install.

5. In the search field, type: "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Install
   markdown-preview-enhanced.
6. Once the install finishes, click on Settings:
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings.png)
7. Once you open the settings for Markdown Preview Enhanced, you should see
   something like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings2.png)
8. Click on the File Extension input field in Settings and type `, .mdx` after
   `.markdown` like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings3.png)
9. Uncheck the check box next to "Break On Single New Line":
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings4.png) You don't need to hit save.
10. Finally, go back to "Install", search for and install "Toolbar Markdown
    Writer".
11. Atom will ask you if you want to install dependencies, click on "Yes":

You should now have a functioning environment in Atom for your work on new
DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources.

## Setting up DARIAH-Campus locally

1. If you haven't used GitHub before, make sure you
   [sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free account before you proceed.
2. Make sure you're logged in on GitHub.com.
3. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your
   computer.
4. Open GitHub Desktop on your computer.
5. Authenticate your GitHub Desktop application with your GitHub credentials by
   following these
   [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github).
6. In your browser, go to
   [https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus)
   and click on "fork". ![](images/github_fork.png)
7. If you are a contributor to various organizational repositories, GitHub may
   ask you to select where you would like to fork dariah-campus. Make your
   choice. ![](images/github_fork_to_which_repo.png)
8. Once the forking finishes, you will be taken to your own personal fork of
   DARIAH-CAMPUS. To make sure you are in the fork, check out that your user
   name (or the name of the organizational repository youo selected in step 7
   above) is displayed in the upper left corner.
   ![](images/github_fork_check_your_name.png)
9. Click on "Clone or download", then select "Open in Desktop".
   ![](images/github_clone_and_open_in_desktop.png)
10. In GitHub Desktop, choose where you want to save the cloned DARIAH-CAMPUS
    fork on your computer. ![](images/github_desktop_saving_a_fork.png)
11. The first you do this, it may take a couple of minutes, but don't despair,
    things will be quicker after the initial clone. Once you finish cloning your
    fork, you should see something like this:
    ![](images/github_desktop_result_of_cloned_fork.png)
12. To get to the folder with DARIAH-CAMPUS on your computer, click on Open in
    Atom (or your preferred editor, if you already set it up).

## Previewing DARIAH-Campus locally

### Step 1 - installing all necessary apps/programs

#### Step 1a) Installing ‘Homebrew’

- Open up Terminal (usually found in ‘Utilities’ on a Mac).
- Go to `https://brew.sh/`
- Select the ‘Install Homebrew’ link and paste it into Terminal
- You will be prompted for a password in Terminal: enter your laptop password.
  The installation will begin.

#### Step 1b) Installing Node.js

To do this,

- type: "`brew install node`" into Terminal and hit ‘return’

Then, you need to install ‘Yarn'

- Type "`brew install yarn`" into Terminal, and hit ‘return’

### Step 2 Installing Node packages

#### Step 2a) Locating and linking folders on your machine

To enable DARIAH-Campus to run locally on your machine, you will need to install
node packages. To do this:

- Find the folder you want to connect to node.js in ‘Finder’ (this will likely
  be the ‘DARIAH-Campus’ folder that you use in Atom).
- In Terminal, type "`cd`" to change direction (also note, be sure to add a
  space after ‘cd’)
- Drag and drop the folder from Finder into Terminal **on the same line as “cd
  “**. This will automatically write the ‘breadcrumb’ to the folder in Terminal.
- Then type "`pwd`" (path to working directory) in Terminal and hit ‘return’
  This will show the correct breadcrumb trail to the folder to make sure you
  have the right one.

#### Step 2b) Installing node packages

- Type "`yarn install`" into Terminal (remember to hit ‘enter’). Installation
  may take a while if you haven’t installed this before. There is a progress bar
  on the bottom of Terminal that shows you how far along you are.

You are now ready to run DARIAH-Campus locally on your machine, so that you can
preview any changes you make without having to commit them.

### Step 3) Running and working with a local version of DARIAH-Campus

#### Step 3a) Installing the package to allow editing

- Type "`yarn develop`" (enter). This is the command to use if you want to
  develop the whole site, with all the necessary options for links and markdown,
  etc. This may also take a little while. If you do not have any problems
  installing this, proceed to **Step 3c**.

#### Step 3b) Troubleshooting any installation problems (if required)

- Open GitHub Desktop.
- Go to ‘Branch’ and select ‘Merge into Current Branch’, then select the most
  recent ‘upstream/master’ file. You will be asked to confirm the merge. Click
  on this.
- You will probably then be prompted to ‘push to origin’ in the GitHub
  interface. This will push it to your local fork.
- Review any changes, and then if you’re happy with them, click on ‘commit to
  master’.
- Click on ‘push origin’.
- In the box that comes up, select ‘open in Atom’.

- In Atom, create a New File, and name it “.env.development”
- In this file, copy and paste:

`GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=TTMMB715TN GATSBY_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=23e184697e638a863376dbd6c151a318 GATSBY_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=dev_DARIAH-CAMPUS`

- Make sure there are three lines, all starting with "`GATSBY`"
- Save this file.
- Once this is saved, re-run installation of ‘yarn develop’ (as in **Step 3a**).
  This should now install correctly.

#### Step 3c) Editing a local version of DARIAH-Campus

You can now view dariah-campus in the browser using the link given to you in the
terminal, which will look like this: ⠀ `http://localhost:8000/`

Copy the url given in Terminal into your browser, which will give you the
DARIAH-Campus home page. Any saved edits you make to the DARIAH-Campus .mdx
files in Atom will automatically be shown on your local version.

> **REMEMBER!!** Any changes you make in Atom will only show up on your local
> version, but will not make any changes to the actual live version of
> DARIAH-Campus. This is useful if you want to try out a few things before
> updating. However, it’s important to remember that if you WANT to make changes
> to the live version, you will need to ‘commit’ them, ‘push origin’ and then
> ‘create a pull request’ so that the DARIAH-Campus editors can approve the
> changes.

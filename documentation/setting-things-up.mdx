DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources are

- written in **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language with easy-to-learn,
  plain-text formatting syntax; and
- hosted on **GitHub**, a popular repository hosting service based on the
  open-source version control software called git.

To develop content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you should:

- use a text editor that supports Markdown. If you don't already use one, we
  recommend Atom.
- be familiar with our GitHub submission and editing workflow.

In this chapter, we'll help you:

- set up Atom as your text editor
- get a copy of DARIAH-Campus on your computer so that you can work on your
  contribution locally
- show you how to run DARIAH-Campus on your computer so that you can preview
  your contribution to see exactly what it would look like once it's published
  on DARIAH-Campus.

## Setting up Atom

If you don't already use a Markdown-enabled text editor but wish to create
content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you may want to use Atom, a customizable,
cross-platform open-source text editor.

If you already use a Markdown-enabled editor, you should continue to do so.
We're providing the instructions how to set up Atom only for those who are new
to Markdown. You should stick to the tools you know (and hopefully like).

1. Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io).
2. Open Atom.
3. Go to Atom > Preferences (if you are on a Mac) or File > Settings (if you are
   on Windows). Then click on Install: ![](images/atom_settings.png)
4. Make sure the "Packages" tab next to the search field is selected. Then type
   "mdxjs" in the search field and wait for results to show up. You should see a
   package called language-mdxjs in the results. Click on install.

5. In the search field, type: "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Install
   markdown-preview-enhanced.
6. Once the install finishes, click on Settings:

7. Once you open the settings for Markdown Preview Enhanced, you should see
   something like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings2.png)
8. Click on the File Extension input field in Settings and type `, .mdx` after
   `.markdown` like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings3.png)
9. Uncheck the check box next to "Break On Single New Line":
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings4.png) You don't need to hit save.
10. Finally, go back to "Install", search for and install "Toolbar Markdown
    Writer".
11. Atom will ask you if you want to install dependencies, click on "Yes":

You should now have a functioning environment in Atom for your work on new
DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources.

## Setting up D-C locally

1. If you haven't used GitHub before, make sure you
   [sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free account before you proceed.
2. Make sure you're logged in on GitHub.com.
3. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your
   computer.
4. Open GitHub Desktop on your computer.
5. Authenticate your GitHub Desktop application with your GitHub credentials by
   following these
   [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github).
6. In your browser, go to
   [https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus)
   and click on "fork". ![](images/github_fork.png)
7. If you are a contributor to various organizational repositories, GitHub may
   ask you to select where you would like to fork dariah-campus. Make your
   choice. ![](images/github_fork_to_which_repo.png)
8. Once the forking finishes, you will be taken to your own personal fork of
   DARIAH-CAMPUS. To make sure you are in the fork, check out that your user
   name (or the name of the organizational repository youo selected in step 7
   above) is displayed in the upper left corner.

10. In GitHub Desktop, choose where you want to save the cloned DARIAH-CAMPUS
    fork on your computer. ![](images/github_desktop_saving_a_fork.png)
11. The first you do this, it may take a couple of minutes, but don't despair,
    things will be quicker after the initial clone. Once you finish cloning your
    fork, you should see something like this:
    ![](images/github_desktop_result_of_cloned_fork.png)
12. To get to the folder with DARIAH-CAMPUS on your computer, click on Open in
    Atom (or your preferred editor, if you already set it up).

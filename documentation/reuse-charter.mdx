Fostering **open access to scholarly resources** as well as collaboration and
fair data-sharing practices among a diverse range of actors involved in
knowledge creation in the Arts and Humanities has been central to DARIAHâ€™s
ambitions from the very beginning. Inspired by the
[Heritage Data Reuse Charter](https://datacharter.hypotheses.org/), the
DARIAH-Campus team has developed the DARIAH-Campus Reuse Charter in order to
declare our clear commitment to the six core principles of Reciprocity,
Interoperability, Citability, Openness, Stewardship and Trustworthiness and show
how this commitment is reflected in the design and the daily operations of the
platform. In addition, as a mutual declaration of goodwill, the charter allows
us to clarify our expectations regarding the interaction between content
creators, users and curators.

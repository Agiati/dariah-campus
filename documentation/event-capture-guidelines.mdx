In a recent report, it was found that the majority of the training contributions
made to DARIAH by its members were events (face-to-face workshops, lectures,
university courses or summer schools). DARIAH is equally committed to supporting
resources that are delivered online and those that are used to support
face-to-face training measures. All of these materials will be hosted and
consolidated in the new DARIAH-Campus platform. To help with this process, we
have provided below some guidelines for making training materials for
face-to-face events available online with DARIAH-Campus.

## 1. The DARIAH-Campus Event Capture Template

We encourage contributions of digital materials from face-to-face training that
are of maximum use to learners, whether they were in attendance at the event or
not. Slideshows, photographs, and videos, whilst forming a record of an eventâ€™s
existence, can lack vital contextualising information. Thus, they often lose
some of their effectiveness online. With this in mind, for summer schools;
conferences; and other larger-scale events we have created a template that aims
to situate these materials within as much contextual information as possible
(such as abstracts; collaboratively-taken notes; other multimedia; contact
details etc). Thus, we encourage the organisers of future DARIAH-associated
training events to capture them within this template, wherever possible, for
inclusion in DARIAH-Campus.

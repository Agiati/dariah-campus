This webinar is the second of the TRIPLE Open Science Training Series.

The training session is dedicated to the EOSC onboarding and is led by Carsten Thiel, Chief Technical Officer at CESSDA ERIC and Joshua Tetteh Ocansey, Technical Officer at CESSDA ERIC. 

The webinar explores the question “How does a service provider get onboarded and listed on the EOSC marketplace?” and as such provides assistance to service providers in sharing services via EOSC with the EOSC Portal and introduces them to some of the benefits of the EOSC Portal. The minimum criteria to become a provider and requirements to onboard services into the EOSC Portal are presented, as well as the EOSC onboarding process. This training session also gathers requirements from the TRIPLE project in order to take them into account for the next iteration of the Portal development.

This recording is of 'Performing, Promoting and Preserving Ireland’s Intangible Cultural Heritage'. This was a live online event co-organised by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Digital Repository of Ireland on 19 August 2021 at 19.00

In the webinar, Manchán Magan leads a lively evening of performance, exploration, and discussion on the theme of intangible cultural heritage. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media speak about the development of the National Inventory. Practitioners and performers from three performing arts give insights into their practices and why they are important. The Digital Repository of Ireland asks us to think about how the preservation of digital records can help to pass practices like these down to future generations.

Since May 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) has been in force in all European member states. This affects not only the private sector, but also the academic one. In the course of an academic career, you will most certainly collect and process personal data from third parties - be it in the context of your research or because your are organizing a conference, where you have to collect personal data of the attendees. This makes it especially important - from a legal and an ethical perspective - that the data processing is done in a GDPR-compliant manner. 

To help you with this, we would likte to introduce you to the most important terms and concepts of the GDPR in this video-tutorial. We will also show you the ELDAH Consent Form Wizard, a tool that allows to create GDPR-compliant consent orms for personal data collection in a research context, and which you can adapt to your particular research purpose.

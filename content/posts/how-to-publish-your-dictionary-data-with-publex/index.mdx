## Introduction

### Publish your dictionary data with Publex!

Publex is a software that allows anyone to publish his/her dictionary data annotated in XML. You can define the display of your dictionary individually.
For this, you do not need to be a professional. The application is very simple, as the program and the user instructions guide you through the entire process.
Moreover, no installation is required. Publex is accessed and operated via the web browser, and the data is stored and published on the Elexis server.

### Three steps to the publication of your dictionary:

**1.	Upload + Metadata**

Upload your XML dictionary data and provide the associated metadata.

Start [here](#creating-a-new-dictionary-and-importing-data).

**2. Configuration**

Specify the layout of your dictionary by defining formatting rules for the XML elements.

![Configuration](images/configuration.svg)

Learn about it [here](#define-your-styling-rules).

**3.	Publication**

Publish the dictionary on the Elexis server. It will have its own URL.

## Let's get started

### Creating an account

![Register](images/register.svg)

To start with Publex directly, you first need to create a profile. For this, click on the register button on the \[link to publex page]. A form will open where you can enter your login credentials. Before completing the registration, you have to accept the terms of use and the privacy policy. Click the register button to complete the process.

### Login

![Login](images/login.svg)

If you already have a user account, you can log in to the home page with your registered e-mail address and your password. 

### Logout

![Logout](images/logout.svg)

Within Publex, you can log out of your profile at any time using the logout icon in the top menu bar.

### Forgot your password?

![Forgot password](images/password.svg)

Click "Forgot Password" in the login form and you will be asked to enter the e-mail address you are registered with. Then you will receive an e-mail with instructions on how to create a new password.

### Changing your password and e-mail adress

Logged in to your account in the upper menu bar, the profile button takes you to the profile management, where you can change your account-related data such as your e-mail address and your password.

## Creating a new dictionary and importing data

### First: Preparing the data

#### 1. Data requirements

##### a) Dictionary entries

- The files are required to be provided in **valid XML**.
- Please make sure that every dictionary text you want to be printed is annotated as a text node. **Dictionary texts should not be encoded as an attribute value**.
- In case of large dictionaries, the files for the dictionary entries should be split into several files. The individual files should **not** be **larger than 16 MB**.

##### b) Use of non-unicode characters

<a id="use-of-non-unicode-characters"></a>If your dictionary contains special characters which are not available in the Unicode standard, it is possible to **use** our **self-defined entities of the [KompLett font](https://tcdh.uni-trier.de/en/projekt/komplett)**. To do this, proceed as follows:

1. Check in this overview \[link to table with name, code position, image to follow] whether your special characters are contained in the allEntities file.

Every entry in the allEntities file is structered as follows: the declaration of a new entry `<!ENTITY` followed by the name, the Unicode `position` (or position in the private used area) and a closing `>`.

Here you can see an example with the special character "u with superscripted plus":

![Entities](images/uplusabove_entities.png)



2. If you want to use a specific entity from the allEntities file, replace the corresponding special character in the XML file with `&entity name;` (entity name = "plusaboveu" in the following example).

![uplusabove_in_xml](images/uplusabove_xml.png)

And this is how the character is finally displayed using the KomplettFont:

![u_plus_above](images/uplusabove_wbnetz.png)



3. Next, download the allEntities file \[here] (link to follow). It must be uploaded with the dictionary files during import. How this works, you will find out [here](#import-entity-file).
   To display the special characters in the published dictionary, it is necessary to select the KompLett font in the configuration. Details can be found in [this section](#define-your-styling-rules).

<SideNote type="note">


- You _don't need_ the allEntities file if your special characters are all defined in the Unicode standard and if you encode all your special characters with hexadecimal codes.
- If you have special characters in your dictionary that are **neither defined in the Unicode Standard nor in our allEntities**, please contact the Publex team \[e-mail address to follow].
</SideNote>

#### 2. Store the data in a Bitbucket repository

The data is imported into Publex from Bitbucket, a Git repository.

1. First of all, to upload data to Bitbucket, you need to **install Git** on your computer. If you don't already have it, please download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. **Log in** to your bitbucket account. If you don't have an account yet, **register** [here](https://bitbucket.org/product/).
3. **Create a new repository**. To do this, click on "create repository" or the plus button next to "Recent repositories" on the welcome page of your account.

![Welcome page Bitbucket](images/home_bitbucket.png)



![Create new repository](images/create_repo.png)



- Select a **project** to which the repo is to be assigned to. If you do not have any projects in your Bitbucket account yet, you can also create a new project at this point.
- Enter a **name** for the new repository, e.g. you can name it after your dictionary.
- Choose the **access level**. If you decide to make your repository **public**, all the data you store in it will be accessible online for everyone. If you do not want this to be possible, select **private**.
- You can include a **README** with a short information about the content of your repository, but this is not necessary for your upload to Publex.
- We recommend to choose 'main' as **default branch name** as suggested by Bitbucket.<a id="branch-name"></a>
- For the field "Include .gitignore?" you can simply use the default setting.
- Now you are ready to hit the "Create repository"-button.

This is how it looks now:

![New repository](images/new_repo.png)



4. Now you can **upload your dictionary data to the repository**.

- To do this, you first have to **clone the repository** which means that you create a copy of it on your local system. When you click the "clone"-button in the right corner, a window will open, **copy the clone command** that appears.

If you prefer to use Bitbucket through a user-friendly interface, we recommend to download [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). In the following, we describe how to perform the steps with the command line:

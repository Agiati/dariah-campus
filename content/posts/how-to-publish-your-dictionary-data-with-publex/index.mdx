## Introduction

### Publish your dictionary data with Publex!

Publex is a software that allows anyone to publish his/her dictionary data annotated in XML. You can define the display of your dictionary individually.
For this, you do not need to be a professional. The application is very simple, as the program and the user instructions guide you through the entire process.
Moreover, no installation is required. Publex is accessed and operated via the web browser, and the data is stored and published on the Elexis server.

### Three steps to the publication of your dictionary:

**1.	Upload + Metadata**

Upload your XML dictionary data and provide the associated metadata.

Start [here](#creating-a-new-dictionary-and-importing-data).

**2. Configuration**

Specify the layout of your dictionary by defining formatting rules for the XML elements.

![Configuration](images/configuration.svg)

Learn about it [here](#define-your-styling-rules).

**3.	Publication**

Publish the dictionary on the Elexis server. It will have its own URL.

## Creating a new dictionary and importing data

### First: Preparing the data

#### 1. Data requirements

##### a) Dictionary entries

- The files are required to be provided in **valid XML**.
- Please make sure that every dictionary text you want to be printed is annotated as a text node. **Dictionary texts should not be encoded as an attribute value**.
- In case of large dictionaries, the files for the dictionary entries should be split into several files. The individual files should **not** be **larger than 16 MB**.

##### b) Use of non-unicode characters

<a id="use-of-non-unicode-characters"></a>If your dictionary contains special characters which are not available in the Unicode standard, it is possible to **use** our **self-defined entities of the [KompLett font](https://tcdh.uni-trier.de/en/projekt/komplett)**. To do this, proceed as follows:

1. Check in this overview \[link to table with name, code position, image to follow] whether your special characters are contained in the allEntities file.

Every entry in the allEntities file is structered as follows: the declaration of a new entry `<!ENTITY` followed by the name, the Unicode `position` (or position in the private used area) and a closing `>`.

Here you can see an example with the special character "u with superscripted plus":

![Entities](images/uplusabove_entities.png)



2. If you want to use a specific entity from the allEntities file, replace the corresponding special character in the XML file with `&entity name;` (entity name = "plusaboveu" in the following example).

![uplusabove_in_xml](images/uplusabove_xml.png)

And this is how the character is finally displayed using the KomplettFont:

![u_plus_above](images/uplusabove_wbnetz.png)



3. Next, download the allEntities file \[here] (link to follow). It must be uploaded with the dictionary files during import. How this works, you will find out [here](#import-entity-file).
   To display the special characters in the published dictionary, it is necessary to select the KompLett font in the configuration. Details can be found in [this section](#define-your-styling-rules).

<SideNote type="note">


- You _don't need_ the allEntities file if your special characters are all defined in the Unicode standard and if you encode all your special characters with hexadecimal codes.
- If you have special characters in your dictionary that are **neither defined in the Unicode Standard nor in our allEntities**, please contact the Publex team \[e-mail address to follow].
</SideNote>

#### 2. Store the data in a Bitbucket repository

The data is imported into Publex from Bitbucket, a Git repository.

1. First of all, to upload data to Bitbucket, you need to **install Git** on your computer. If you don't already have it, please download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. **Log in** to your bitbucket account. If you don't have an account yet, **register** [here](https://bitbucket.org/product/).
3. **Create a new repository**. To do this, click on "create repository" or the plus button next to "Recent repositories" on the welcome page of your account.

![Welcome page Bitbucket](images/home_bitbucket.png)



![Create new repository](images/create_repo.png)



- Select a **project** to which the repo is to be assigned to. If you do not have any projects in your Bitbucket account yet, you can also create a new project at this point.
- Enter a **name** for the new repository, e.g. you can name it after your dictionary.
- Choose the **access level**. If you decide to make your repository **public**, all the data you store in it will be accessible online for everyone. If you do not want this to be possible, select **private**.
- You can include a **README** with a short information about the content of your repository, but this is not necessary for your upload to Publex.
- We recommend to choose 'main' as **default branch name** as suggested by Bitbucket.<a id="branch-name"></a>
- For the field "Include .gitignore?" you can simply use the default setting.
- Now you are ready to hit the "Create repository"-button.

This is how it looks now:

![New repository](images/new_repo.png)



4. Now you can **upload your dictionary data to the repository**.

- To do this, you first have to **clone the repository** which means that you create a copy of it on your local system. When you click the "clone"-button in the right corner, a window will open, **copy the clone command** that appears.

![Copy clone command](images/clone_command.png)

If you prefer to use Bitbucket through a user-friendly interface, we recommend to download [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). In the following, we describe how to perform the steps with the command line:

First open the terminal. This works differently depending on the platform you use:

a) using Windows: Hold down the Windows key on your keyboard and then press the "R" key. Now the "Run" tool will open in a new pop-up window. Type in "cmd" and hit "OK".


b) using Mac: To open terminal from your applications folder, click your desktop to bring "Finder" into focus. In the menu bar, click "Go" and select "Applications".


c) using Linux: Press Ctrl+Alt+T.

- Once opened the terminal window, change into the local directory where you want to clone your repository.
  `cd <path_to_directory>`
- Paste the command you copied from Bitbucket, e.g.:
  `git clone https://Trifoglio@bitbucket.org/Trifoglio/my_dictionary.git`
- Now a new sub-directory should appear on your local drive with the same name as the repository.
- In this directory, **create a new folder** which you call "data" for example.
- **Put all the files that belong to your dictionary into this folder**. Note: If you want to use entities from the KompLett font, you must also place the file allEntities.xml in this folder.
- Now you are almost finished. The final step is to transfer the locally added files to the remote Bitbucket Cloud repository. In your terminal window:

  - enter `cd <path_to_local_repo>`
  - enter `git add --all`
  - enter  `git commit -m '<commit_message>'` with a commit message that describes your changes, e.g. `git commit -m 'upload dictionary data'`
  - enter `git push`

If everything worked fine, you should now see the files in your repository online in your Bitbucket account.
Now we are prepared to create a new dictionary in Publex!

### Creating a new dictionary

1. To create a new dictionary, start on the Dictionary Overview page and click on **"New Dictionary"**.

![Dictionary Overview](images/dictionary_overview.png)

2. A new window opens. Type in the **name** of your new dictionary and optionally a description.

![Add new dictionary](images/new_dictionary.png)



3. Now you have two different options:

   a) You can create an empty dictionary first and import the data at a later time. Then click on "Create empty dictionary". The new dictionary will appear in the Dictionary Overview afterwards.

   b) You can import your dictionary data directly. Hit the button "Add Dictionary and go to XML file import". The dictionary is created and the import page opens.

### Import

1. There are two possible ways to get to the **import page**:
   a) You create a new dictionary and immediately go to the XML file import (see [here](#creating-a-new-dictionary)).
   b) In the Dictionary Overview, select a dictionary that has already been created and click on **"Edit Dictionary"**.

   ![Edit dictionary](images/edit_dictionary.png)

In the menu bar on the left, under **"Dictionary Management"**, select **"XML File Import"**.

![Left menu bar](left_menu.png)

2. Now you have to provide Publex with the information where to find your dictionary data.

![Define import](images/import_data.png)

a) The **URL of the Bitbucket repository** where you stored the data. You get the URL by clicking on the clone-Button in your Bitbucket repository and choosing "SSH" in the dropdown menu in the right upper corner. The last part of the displayed string is the URL you need.

![Clone Button](images/clone_button_bitbucket.png)



![Repo URL](images/clone_ssh.png)



b) The **branch** in which the data is stored. It's the one you chose as default branch name when creating your Bitbucket repository (see [here](#branch-name)).

c) Tell Publex, whether your repository is public or private.

1. If your repository is public, no further settings are necessary for the import.  If it is a private repository, please mark the checkbox "This is a private Git repository!".


   ![Private Git](images/privategit.png)
2. By activating the button, a SSH key becomes visible. Please add this key to your Bitbucket account.

- Copy the key.
- In your Bitbucket account, go to your personal settings (see the icon for your account in the left corner on the bottom).


  ![Personal settings](images/personal_settings.png)
- In personal settings, go to "SSH keys" and click on "Add key". A Window opens where you can paste your key you copied from Publex.

  ![Add key](images/add_key.png)

  d) The **name of the directory** you stored you dictionary files in, e.g. "data" as chosen in our example.

  e) The **file extension** of your files containing the dictionary data which should be **xml** as recommended.

  f) <a id="import-entity-file"></a> The **entity file name**: If you would like to use our self-defined entities to display non-unicode characters (see [here](#use-of-non-unicode-characters)), enter the file name **"allEntities.xml"** here. If not, the field should remain empty.

  Now you are ready to hit the button **Import Data**. The import starts now. It may take a couple of time depending on how large your data is. In the output window, you can follow the progress of the import and also see if problems or errors occur. If "Everything successfully imported." is displayed, the import was successful. Click "Go to Styling Rules" to continue with the [configuration](#define-your-styling-rules) of your dictionary.  

  #### Publex Test-Git

  As assistance we offer a small dictionary test data set. Via the button "Use Publex Test-Git" the corresponding data are entered into the form and the test dictionary can be imported.

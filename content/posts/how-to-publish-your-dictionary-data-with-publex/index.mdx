## Introduction

### Publish your dictionary data with Publex!

Publex is a software that allows anyone to publish his/her dictionary data annotated in XML. You can define the display of your dictionary individually.
For this, you do not need to be a professional. The application is very simple, as the program and the user instructions guide you through the entire process.
Moreover, no installation is required. Publex is accessed and operated via the web browser, and the data is stored and published on the Elexis server.

### Three steps to the publication of your dictionary:

**1.	Upload + Metadata**

Upload your XML dictionary data and provide the associated metadata.

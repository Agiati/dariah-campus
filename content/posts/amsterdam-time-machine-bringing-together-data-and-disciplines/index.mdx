abstract: In this lecture from the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ADCH-CH), Marieke van Erp shares her experiences working on the CLARIAH-funded project Amsterdam Time Machine. The project's aim is linking geographical, linguistic and media-specific data about Amsterdam together through space and time by applying linked open data methodology. In this talk, van Erp expands on the challenges of this project and working interdisciplinarily.

The Amsterdam Time Machine is a digital research infrastructure project that aims to create a historical linked open data hub about Amsterdam, linking people, places, relationships, events and objects through space and time. It is part of the European Time Machine Consortium, an expanding network of local initiatives, which Vienna, too, has recently joined, committing to the establishment of a local Time Machine branch.

In her lecture, Marieke van Erp, leader of the Digital Humanities Lab at the KNAW Humanities Cluster in Amsterdam, shares her insights into the work on and with the Amsterdam Time Machine, presenting three use cases based on data from the late 19th and early 20th century. Funded in 2018 by CLARIAH-NL, these pilot projects for the Time Machine each bring their own facets to the history of Amsterdam. Exploring Amsterdam dialects and sociolects, social mobility, and the consumption and reception of films, respectively, they do not only present researchers with data integration challenges - for example dealing with street name changes through time - but also with the challenge of working together across research disciplines. In her talk, Marieke will present the results of the CLARIAH Amsterdam Time Machine pilot project, and share her experiences on how linguists, socio-economic historians, media studies and geographical information systems experts have learnt to ‘read’ each others’ data and use it to enrich their own use cases.

## Abstract

_Session 1_

In this workshop, participants will be encouraged to examine their own scholarly
practices and those of others, refining our responses to the fundamental
question: “what are Humanities research data?” The ways in which Humanities
methods and practices have changed to respond to digital research data will be
explored in more detail. The session will combine lecture and discussion with a
hands-on exercise in evaluating diverse Humanities sources, testing our ability
to identify and to extract Humanities research data, and to respond to such
objects in a way that reflects their digital nature. After a warm-up session
dedicated to theoretical reflections on the role of data within humanities
research and cultural heritage studies, the session gently introduce the
participants to the basics in research data management, data services and the
FAIR principles in a humanities context, just to see how all these at first
possibly fairly abstract new concepts help do more effective research if they
are well-translated into community practices. Participants will travel through
the research data lifecycle from planning, organising, documenting, processing,
storing and protecting your data to sharing and publishing them. Participants
are encouraged to discuss data management issues related to their own projects
(or project ideas) ideas and to contact the trainers beforehand.

commitment to democracy in science led her to join ScienceOpen, a research
evaluation and discovery platform, as Content Integration Manager and open
science advocate. Her role at DARIAH enables her to merge the 2 main pillars of
her professional life: humanities and open science. She is responsible for
fostering and implementing open science practices across DARIAH and its
cooperating partners and contributes to the design and implementation of open
science policy statements, guidelines and service related to the open

## Abstract

_Session 2_

This session will provide an overview of persistent identifiers, outline their
importance and also provide an overview of how to cite data and software. During
this highly interactive session we will both overview the why and how of data
and software citation and discuss issues which can be encountered specifically
in a humanities context.

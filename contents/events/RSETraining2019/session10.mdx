_Community Pointers_

This final session of the workshop started with the presentation of UK and
European DH infrastructures and organisations, a list of links to
internationally recognised policies and best practices in DH, important
peer-reviewed journals and mailing lists dedicated to diverse aspects of human
and technical research infrastructures that may be of relevance to the MaDiH
project and of interest to its members.

The second part of the session was dedicated to discussion and requirements
elicitation for the MaDiH project.

# Day Three Session Two

## Abstract

_Practical methods in digital heritage (3D modelling, photogrammetry, XR)_

Moving on to specific examples and RSE methods, the session started with a brief introduction to digital 3D-modelling and its applications for DH research. 3D-models help preserve fragile artefacts by allowing close examination without endangering the objects themselves, defy distance by making study of objects in dispersed collections possible and reconstruct no longer existing environments in order to provoke emotional and intellectual responses and facilitate research. A useful way of thinking about 3D modelling consists in differentiating between “acquisition” (i.e. direct scanning or sensing of a physical surface) and “creation” (i.e. manual, interpretative (re)construction).

The second part of the session was dedicated to photogrammetry, a set of techniques and tools for extracting three-dimensional data from images. The necessary equipment and available software tools as well as the frictions between “ideal set-up” and the more realistic contexts of noisy environments for capturing images were discussed. Different stages of the photogrammetry process (of the “photogrammetry pipeline”) such as Natural Feature Extraction, Image Matching, Features Matching, Structure from Motion, Depth maps estimation, Meshing and Texturing were outlined. Limitations of the method and ways of counteracting them were mentioned. The session concluded with a practical exercise, equipment demonstrations and a taste of immersive experiences.

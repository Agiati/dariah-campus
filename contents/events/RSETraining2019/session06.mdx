# Day Three Session One

## Abstract

_Requirement Analysis and Data Modelling for MaDiH_

During this project-specific session, the information presented in the first two days of the workshop was applied further to the concrete example of the Mapping Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan (MaDiH) project. The session discussed the requirement elicitation phase of the project, presented the template for requirements elicitations developed at KDL, the project’s CKAN instance and the workflow for the identification and entry of datasets and resources, with reference to supporting techniques, such as interview template and diary/log, and standard SDLC operational methods, such as the review process.

###RSE in Action

The session was followed by two short presentations by partners showcasing other projects:

1) Arts of Making (Will Wootton, Department of Classics, King’s College London)
2) Getty Digital Itineraries of Art History (Stuart Dunn, Dept of Digital Humanities, King’s College London)

# Day Three: Session One

## Abstract

_Requirement Analysis and Data Modelling for MaDiH_

During this project-specific session, the information presented in the first two
days of the workshop was applied further to the concrete example of the Mapping
Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan (MaDiH) project. The session discussed the
requirement elicitation phase of the project, presented the template for
requirements elicitations developed at KDL, the project’s CKAN instance and the
workflow for the identification and entry of datasets and resources, with
reference to supporting techniques, such as interview template and diary/log,
and standard SDLC operational methods, such as the review process.

###RSE in Action

The session was followed by two short presentations by partners showcasing other
projects:

1. Arts of Making ([Will Wootton](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/will-wootton),
   Department of Classics, King’s College London)
2. Getty Digital Itineraries of Art History

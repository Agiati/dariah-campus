# Day Two Session One

## Abstract

_From project idea to requirements_

At the beginning of the session, the elements to be taken into consideration while planning any DH project were named and discussed, to illustrate basic concepts around a Core idea, which typically evolve into more refined Research questions, Methods to address them, Management, Budget to support the project and Sustainability issues at stake.

When it comes to development, in contrast to traditional project management approaches that fix the features to be implemented in the course of the project, Agile project management approaches, adopted by KDL, treat time and cost as fixed variables. Instead of committing to implementing a set of features, the team commits to delivering value within defined constraints of cost and time, whereas features may change as the project progresses.

At pre-project stage, feasibility analysis needs to be conducted before a project is considered viable and the rest of the life cycle initiated. In order to prioritise requirements, KDL uses the prioritisation technique known as the MoSCow principles, whereby, following consultation with the partners, each required feature is assigned a status: M for “must”, S for “should”, C for “can” and W for “will not have this time”.  W requirements, although recorded by the analyst, are considered to be outside the scope of the project, and C requirements are considered low priority. In the iterative process of project development, this prioritisation technique is used throughout the project at review meetings.

Given this training workshop was part of the specific project MaDiH (مديح) Mapping Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan with defined core idea and high level requirements, the rest of the session focused on the project deliverables. Producing a Proof of Concept (PoC) is one of the objectives of the project – the notion of prototype, proving that a scaled-up version of the project can be executed, was therefore discussed and critiqued as RSE best practice to encourage review of and reflection on the project’s feasibility and gap analysis.

The session further provided some examples taken from the MaDiH pre-project stage and demonstrated KDL’s template for requirement analysis.

In addition, the applications of the “Comprehensive Archive Network” (CKAN) system, widely used across the public sector, as proposed solution for capturing metadata in MaDiH was discussed as an example of how an RSE solution evolves through the KDL SDLC.

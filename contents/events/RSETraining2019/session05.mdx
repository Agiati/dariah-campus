# Day Two: Session Two

## Abstract

_Data Modelling_

This session started with a discussion of the concepts of Data, Information and
Knowledge. A data model, i.e. a _formalised description of how to organize data
in an information system_, is the backbone of most RSE evolving solutions. One
way of modelling data is by creating an ontology, that is an explicit set of
relational statements connecting entities (e.g. artefacts, places, people,
events). Ontologies not only help organise data for the purposes of a particular
project, they also make future integration and reuse of structured data
possible.

The session traced the meaning of the term “ontology” from philosophy to data
modelling, where it is used to designate conceptualisation and agreed upon
representation of data about a knowledge domain.

There are two approaches to building ontologies. One can be described as realist
(that strives to render full complexity), the other as pragmatic (that focuses
on representation of data best suited for the project and purpose in question).
Due to the often complex and ambiguous nature of data in the Humanities and
Cultural Heritage sectors, DH scholars often favour the pragmatic approach. In
order to understand the concept of ontology, metaphors such as “agreement”,
“contract” or “compromise” were introduced as useful semantic devices in the
data modelling process.

Access to expert knowledge about the domain and reflection on the future uses of
the data were discussed as essential constituent parts of this process.

After analysing a set of examples from the “Henry III Fine Rolls” project, the
session concluded with a detailed discussion of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference
Model (CRM) as a guide for good practice in conceptual modelling in the
Humanities and Cultural heritage.

The afternoon of Day Two was dedicated to a visit to the
[British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhrSG-Ymp5wIVWODtCh15GAg3EAAYASAAEgI91_D_BwE)
led by Dominic Oldman and Diana Tanase.

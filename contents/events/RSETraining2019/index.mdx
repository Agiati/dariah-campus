  Hosted by King’s Digital Lab (KDL) at
  King’s College London, this was the first workshop of Phase 1 of the AHRC-funded "MaDiH: Mapping the Digital
  Cultural Heritage in Jordan" Project. Led by the Project PI in London Dr James Smithies (Director of KDL) and Dr Arianna Ciula (Deputy Director of KDL), it introduced the
  project team to KDL’s project management practices and Agile DSDM Process.
  Discussions on data modelling and ontologies informed one of the main outcomes
  of MaDiH Phase 1 a prototype of a National Data Catalogue. In addition,
  practical methods in digital heritage were explored, with presentations from
  Neil Jakeman (KDL) on photogrammetry and Dr Adrian Evans and Tom Sparrow
  (University of Bradford) about scanning tools and technology and VR
  exploration of museum spaces as well as the potential for this emerging
  technology to contribute to the reconstruction of destroyed cultural heritage.

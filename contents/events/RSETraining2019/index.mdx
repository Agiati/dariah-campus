abstract:
  Hosted by King’s Digital Lab (KDL) at King’s College London, this was the
  first workshop of Phase 1 of the AHRC-funded project 'MaDiH Mapping the
  Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan' Project. The workshop introduced the
  MaDiH team to KDL’s project management practices and the Agile DSDM Process.
  Discussions on data modelling and  ontologies informed one of the main
  outcomes of MaDiH Phase 1, i.e. a prototype of a National Data Catalogue. In
  addition, practical methods and theoretical approaches to digital heritage
  were explored, with presentations on photogrammetry for reconstruction of
  destroyed cultural heritage and on data sovereignty.

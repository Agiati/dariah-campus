abstract: The first workshop of Phase 1 of the AHRC-funded “MaDiH: Mapping the Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan” Project, hosted by King’s Digital Lab (KDL) at King’s College London. Led by the Project PI in London Dr James Smithies (KDL Director) and Dr Arianna Ciula, (Deputy Director of KDL), it introduced the project team to KDL’s project management practices and Agile DSDM Process. Discussions on data modelling and ontologies informed one of the main outcomes of MaDiH Phase 1: a prototype of a National Data Catalogue. In addition, practical methods in digital heritage were explored, with presentations from Neil Jakeman (KDL) on photogrammetry and Dr Adrian Evans and Tom Sparrow (University of Bradford) about scanning tools and technology and VR exploration of museum spaces as well as the potential for this emerging technology to contribute to the reconstruction of destroyed cultural heritage.

abstract:
  Have you ever reflected on the origin and authenticity of an historical source
  that you retrieved on the web? This lesson, published on the teaching platform
  for digital source criticism Ranke2, offers insights into how the practice of
  applying source criticism has been affected by the digital turn. What are the
  new questions that historians should ask to digitised and digital born
  historical sources and what new skills should they master to be able to answer
  these questions? Explore Ranke.2 by venturing into a mix of animations,
  quizzes and hands on assignments.

As historians, we are confronted with an abundance of data in digital form that
can be searched, annotated, analysed, presented and reused with the help of a
broad array of digital tools.

But what do we know about how digital technology affects the artefactual and
informational value of a source?

When looking through the lens of source criticism to digitized and digital born
sources, there are so many mediating processes going on before a source can
appear on our screen, that historians run the risk of getting detached from the
original context of the source.

The premise of the lesson _From the Archival to the Digital turn_ available on
the [Ranke.2 platform](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/) is that
historians of the 21st century need to have a basic understanding of the process
of digitisation, of the creation of digital born sources and of the algorithms
that drive search engines.

The lesson starts off with a short animation lasting 6.30 minutes, narrated by
prof. [Andreas Fickers](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/andreas-fickers), in
which he expands on the origin of the method of source criticism and on how it
should be adapted to meet the requirements of present day scholarship.

The clip is repeated a second time, but then in the form of a quiz to enable you
to test your understanding of the content. This is followed by a series of
assignments that connect to the topics in the animation in an accessible and
engaging way:

- Reflecting on how "films", like the ones created by
  [Edward Muybridge; the father of the Gif](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/#assignment-01-muybridge-legacy.en)
  are represented on the web.
- Comparing letters with emails:

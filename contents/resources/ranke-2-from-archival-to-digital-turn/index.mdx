abstract:
  How has the digital turn affected the method of source criticism? This lesson,
  published on the teaching platform for digital source criticism Ranke2, offers
  insights into the challenges for historians of applying source criticism to
  digitised and digital born data that is published on the web. What are the new
  questions that should be asked to historical sources and what computational
  understanding do historians need to be able to answer these questions?
type: training module

As historians, we are confronted with an abundance of data in digital form that
can be searched, annotated, analysed, presented and reused with the help of a
broad array of digital tools.

But what do we know about how digital technology affects the artefactual and
informational value of a source?

When looking through the lens of source criticism to digitized and digital born
sources, there are so many mediating processes going on before a source can
appear on our screen, that historians run the risk of getting detached from its
original context.

The premise of the lesson _From the Archival to the Digital turn_ available on
the [Ranke.2 platform](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/) is that
historians need to have a basic understanding of digitisation, of how digital
born sources are created and of how search engines work. By comparing the
digital turn to an earlier paradigm shift in professional history, the archival
turn at the end of the 19th century, this lesson helps you to reflect on what
has changed in the practice of historians.

The lesson starts with a short animation lasting 6 minutes 30 seconds. Narrated
by prof. [Andreas Fickers](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/andreas-fickers), this
video tells the story of how the historianâ€™s craft has changed and what we need
to learn in order to be able to apply source criticism to digital sources. At
the end of the video, you can check whether you have remembered the key messages
with a simple quiz.

The content is directly accessible, and can serve the needs of students,
lecturers and independent learners. This is one of the lessons that anyone can
access on the Teaching Platform
[Ranke.2 - Source Criticism in the Digital Age](https://ranke2.uni.lu).

Besides the quiz, a series of eight assignments expand and deepen the topics
that are briefly discussed in the animation in unexpected and engaging way:

1. analysing "films", like
   [Edward Muybridge; the father of the Gif](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/#assignment-01-muybridge-legacy.en)
2. Letters and emails:
   [The ties of Hillary Clinton and Margaret Thatcher with the Middle East](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/#assignment-04-clinton-email-thatcher.en)
   in collaboration with [Max Kemman](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/max-kemman)
3. And photographs:
   [The glass plates of German photographer August Sander](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/#assignment-04-clinton-email-thatcher.en)
   collaboration with
   [Juliane Tatarinov](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/juliane-tatarinov)

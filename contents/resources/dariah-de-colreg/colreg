# firstname-lastname is a slug pointing to the record in /contents/data/person.yaml

categories:
  - dariah
# categories are what on the frontend we call sources, see: https://campus.dariah.eu/sources. A category listed here must exist in /contents/data/category.yaml. Do not create new categories unless you get a go-ahead from DARIAH-Campus editors.

  - Research infrastructures

  - Repositories & Collections
# choose up to five keywords for the resource. All lower case, multiple words joined by hyphens (so-called "slugs"). A tag listed here must also exist in /contents/data/tag.yaml. If you think your resource needs a new tag, feel free to do so by listting it here and adding it (name, slug, description) in /contents/data/tag.yaml. The editors will try to keep the number of tags manageable. Tags are used to group resources around topics, see: https://campus.dariah.eu/tags
abstract: Short teaser about the contents of your resource.
A virtual place where you can both register, store, and find descriptions of research collections - that place is the DARIAH-DE Collection Registry. Following up on the DARIAH-DE Publikator, the Collection Registry enables you to index the data you have uploaded to the DARIAH-DE Repository with an extensive metadata model (DCDDM).
# Abstracts are displayed in the previews of individual resources, like here: https://campus.dariah.eu/resources. Abstracts should be very short and briefly introduce what the resource is about. Abstracts are not displayed at the beginning of the actual content of the resource. If you want to use the same text as the teaser and as the first paragraph of your resource, you need to put that text as abstract in the metadata, and as a regular paragraph at the beginning of your resource.

This manual describes and explains the DARIAH-DE Collection Registry, a tool that is commonly used in combination with the **[DARIAH-DE Publikator](https://campus.dariah.eu/resource/dariah-de-publikator-tutorial)**. The Collection Registry enables you to describe collections with metadata, using the DARIAH Collection Description Data Model (DCDDM). Based on the Dublin Core Collections Application Profile (DCCAP), the DCDDM allows for collection descriptions that are both human- and machine-readable. Not only digital collections but also analogoue collections can be described.

In the Collection Registry, collection references are collected and described, and not the data of the collections themselves (like in the Publikator). Via a graphical user interface, you can describe your collections in different categories, depending on the metadata you have available.

The manual is conveniently divided into two sections: general information on collections, and a user guide. It gives step-by-step instructions on how to work with the Collection Registry. Eventually, best practice examples are given which illustrate an ideal case for your use of the Collection Registry.

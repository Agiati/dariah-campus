abstract:
  This lesson from Ranke.2 looks at how digital technology has stirred our
  imagination and enabled us to create new (and sometimes virtual) realities;
  and covers topics ranging from ancient Greek myths to snapchat filters.
  However, the availability of this technology to transform both us and the
  world around us should be treated with skepticism, as the merits of an
  all-encompassing digital lifestyle do not completely outweigh its
  disadvantages and pitfalls.

As historians, we are confronted with an abundance of data in digital form that
can be searched, annotated, analysed, presented and reused with the help of a
broad array of digital tools.

But what do we know about how digital technology affects the artefactual and
informational value of a source?

When looking through the lens of source criticism to digitized and digital born
sources, there are so many mediating processes going on before a source can
appear on our screen, that historians run the risk of getting detached from the
original context of the source.

The premise of the lesson _Transformation; How the Digital Creates New
Realities_ available on the
[Ranke.2 platform](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/transformation/) is that the idea of
'transformation' is not a novel concept, but rather one that has been around for
millennia. However, the advances of technology have allowed new and different
ways for us to understand and practise transformation in the digital realm.

This lesson incorporates video animations, assignments and quizzes to support
your learning.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lesson you should:

- Understand the difference between scholarly criticism and digital scholarly
  criticism
- Understand how definitions of 'metamorphosis' and 'transformation' have
  evolved
- Identify and appreciate the impact digital transformations can have in our
  society, including on our mental health, and the rise of 'fake news'

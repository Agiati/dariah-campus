abstract:
  This lesson looks at how digital technology has stirred our imagination and
  enabled us to create new (and sometimes virtual) realities; and covers topics
  ranging from ancient Greek myths to snapchat filters... However, the
  availability of this technology to transform both us and the world around us
  should be treated with skepticism, as the merits of an all-encompassing
  digital lifestyle do not completely outweigh its disadvantages and pitfalls.

As historians, we are confronted with an abundance of data in digital form that
can be searched, annotated, analysed, presented and reused with the help of a
broad array of digital tools.

But what do we know about how digital technology affects the artefactual and
informational value of a source?

When looking through the lens of source criticism to digitized and digital born
sources, there are so many mediating processes going on before a source can
appear on our screen, that historians run the risk of getting detached from the
original context of the source.

The premise of the lesson _Transformation; How the Digital Creates New
Realities_ available on the
[Ranke.2 platform](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/transformation/) is that the idea of
'transformation' is not a novel concept, but rather one that has been around for
millennia. However, the advances of technology have allowed new and different
ways for us to understand and practice transformation in the digital realm.

The lesson starts off with a short animation lasting 2.30 minutes, narrated by
researcher
[Stefania Scagliola](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/stefania-scagliola), In
which she discusses the concept of transformation and how technology has changed
the way we communicate and transfer knowledge as well as how the ‘digital’ has
created new encounters that seem real, but sometimes are able to deceive and
seduce our senses.

The clip is then repeated a second time in the form of a quiz to enable you to
test your understanding of the content. This is followed by a series of
assignments that connect to the topics in the animation in an accessible and
engaging way:

- Such as using
  [image recognition software](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/transformation/#assignment-01-screenshotsIRS.en)
  to understand how images can transform and change from one medium to another
- Understanding how
  [copyright and remixing are essential parts of creating and creativity](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/transformation/#assignment-02-copyright.en)
- Tracing the
  [evolution of the two terms 'metamorphosis' and 'transformation' over time](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/transformation/#assignment-03-metamorphtransform.en)
  to understand how they arrived at their current definitions
- Looking into
  [transforming your appearance online](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/transformation/#assignment-04.-online-appearance.en)
  with snapchat and the psychological effects of narcissism
- Examining some of the issues that stem from the digital transformation of our
  society, including
